# Legacy documentation 

You should upgrade to the most recent version for documentation support. The documentation for product versions that are either outdated or have reached their end-of-life is available in a PDF format. Percona does not update this documentation. 

Use the left sidebar to select the following:

* Product type
* Product name
* Outdated or end of life version

Then you can download the PDF for the required version.
