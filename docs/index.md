# Legacy documentation 

You should upgrade to the most recent version for documentation support. The documentation for product versions that are either outdated or have reached their end-of-life is available in a PDF format. Outdated documentation is defined as the documentation for versions that are no longer actively maintained, but these versions are not declared end-of-life. Percona does not update this documentation. 

Use the left sidebar to select the following:

* Product type
* Product name
* Outdated or end-of-life version

Then download the PDF for that version.
