# Legacy documentation 

You should upgrade to the most recent version for documentation support. For the versions that have reached their end-of-life, we provide the legacy documentation in a PDF format. Percona does not update legacy documentation.

Find the PDFs for the versions that have reached their end-of-life in the sidebar menu to the left.
