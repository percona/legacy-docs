# Legacy documentation 

You should upgrade to the most recent version for documentation support. For the versions that have reached their end-of-life, we provide the legacy documentation in a PDF format. Percona does not update legacy documentation.

Use the left sidebar to select the following:

* Product type
* Product name
* End of life version

Then you can download the PDF for the required version.
